@par Example Description 

In this application, the module will open a server socket itself and wait for a 
client to connect to it. The client program that is used for this application is 
the SocketTest3 which is provided as an utility program in the folder Utilities.

Within the SocketTest3 application please click on "Client" tab and enter the host IP address and the 
socket port number as 32000. And then click on "Connect" button to connect to the opened server socket.

This program assumes some default settings in the source code which are important
to make the wifi module search, connect and communicate. The default settings 
may be changed by the user in order for him/her to use the program in a correct
manner and get the desired output. The settings used in this program and which 
need to be changed by the user are:

  - Mini Access-Point to create, ssid = "SWPF_AS01"
  
The user may replace the above settings with his/her own specific details directly in the source code.
Otherwise there is also the option to enter the settings during run-time of the program.

The program takes input via the serial terminal (any terminal program like tera-term on the PC). The
serial port settings of the terminal are as follows:
  - baud rate: 115200
  - data: 8bit
  - parity: None
  - Stop-bits: 1bit
  - HW Flow Control: None
  
The user is asked by the program if he/she wants to enter any new settings for the Wifi and the user
must choose option (y) to enter the new settings.
The user is prompted by the program to enter the above described details at the start of the execution
of the program. The user needs to correctly enter his/her wifi settings and host name details
(delete is recognized as an ASCII key). Here is a snapshot of the output of the program at the outset:

Do you want to setup SSID?(y/n):y

Enter the SSID for mini-AP:<Enter the name of the mini-AP as wanted>
  
@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32 Nucleo devices with WIFI1 (Wi-Fi) expansion board
    (X-NUCLEO-IDW01M1/X-NUCLEO-IDw04A1)
  - For X-NUCLEO-IDW01M1 the following boards are supported: STM32L053R8-Nucleo, STM32F401RE-Nucleo, STM32L476RG-Nucleo and STM32F103RB-Nucleo
  - For X-NUCLEO-IDW04A1 the following boards are supported: STM32F401RE-Nucleo and STM32L476RG-Nucleo
    

@par How to use it? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - WARNING: before opening the project with any toolchain be sure your folder
   installation path is not too in-depth since the toolchain may report errors
   after building.
 - Open IAR toolchain (this firmware has been successfully tested with
   Embedded Workbench V7.40.5).
   Alternatively you can use the Keil uVision toolchain (this firmware
   has been successfully tested with V5.17.0.0).
   Alternatively you can use the System Workbench for STM32 (SW4STM32) toolchain (this firmware
   has been successfully tested with V1.0.0).
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory.
 - Run the example.
 - Alternatively, you can download the pre-built binaries in "Binary" 
   folder included in the distributed package.
